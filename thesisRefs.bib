	abstract = {Research in program comprehension has considerably evolved over the past two decades. However, only little is known about how developers practice program comprehension under time and project pressure, and which methods and tools proposed by researchers are used in industry. This paper reports on an observational study of 28 professional developers from seven companies, investigating how developers comprehend software. In particular we focus on the strategies followed, information needed, and tools used.},

	abstract = {Objective: To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development.
Method: An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon.
Result: A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon.
Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes. Future research should incorporate empirical studies to validate heuristics and techniques that will assist practitioners in their management of technical debt.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose and empirically validate a suite of hotspot patterns: recurring architecture problems that occur in most complex systems and incur high maintenance costs. In particular, we introduce two novel hotspot patterns, Unstable Interface and Implicit Cross-module Dependency. These patterns are deﬁned based on Baldwin and Clark’s design rule theory, and detected by the combination of history and architecture information. Through our tool-supported evaluations, we show that these patterns not only identify the most error-prone and changeprone ﬁles, they also pinpoint speciﬁc architecture problems that may be the root causes of bugginess and change proneness. Signiﬁcantly, we show that 1) these structure-history integrated patterns contribute more to error- and change-proneness than other hotspot patterns, and 2) the more hotspot patterns a ﬁle is involved in, the more error- and change-prone it is. Finally, we report on an industrial case study to demonstrate the practicality of these hotspot patterns. The architect and developers conﬁrmed that our hotspot detector discovered the majority of the architecture problems causing maintenance pain, and they have started to improve the system’s maintainability by refactoring and ﬁxing the identiﬁed architecture issues.},

Along the way, developments in technologies (printing, reproduction), mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content.},
