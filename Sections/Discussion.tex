- The importance of having a place for structuring and communicating about technical debt in order to successfully manage it and with that also be able to take advantage of the positive aspects of debt.

- The difficulty in presenting an overview of the debt in a single view since debt lives on many levels in a project. Some dimensions of debt are present in very specific locations in the source code an requires a single file overview to be able to localize in the project, where as some other dimensions of debt like architecture or environmental debt can span multiple micro services or code repositories and requires a much broader view of the project to be able to show the location.
