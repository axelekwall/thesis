Previous research has been published investigating software evolution through different visualization techniques. Bayer and Hassan developed "Evolution Storyboards"  , examples include code-swarm, CVSscan and Software evolution storylines. However, during the last decade tools and workflows used by software development teams have evolved and more information is recorded with every change, allowing for rich analyses of the history and evolution of software source code.

The previous work mentioned contributed with valuable knowledge and in doing that also created new questions to be answered. In comparison to CVSscan which focuses on single files, this thesis will investigate a whole repository of source code to give a better overview and richer understanding about how the whole projects evolves. code-swarm and Software evolution storylines presented intuitive visual mappings for data points but targeted casual users and did not allow for interaction and deeper exploration of the data. In contrast, this study targets advanced users with domain knowledge and information about the context of the software project, allowing for a more advanced interactive visualization tool that presents complex information.
