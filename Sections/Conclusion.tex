\section{Conclusion}
This study explores whether technical debt communication and management can be improved by introducing a visualization tool.
A \textit{concept driven design research} methodology was used, and an interactive prototype was designed and developed in order to evaluate the visualization tool concept.
The prototype was evaluated among users and the findings suggests that a tool, like the one proposed through the concept in this study, would improve communication and awareness about technical debt in software development projects.
The potential for improvements in the technical debt representation and overview visualizations are discussed and suggestions for further research are presented withing these areas.
In conclusion, this study illustrates the opportunities available to improve technical debt management by leveraging visualization in order to raise awareness and encourage communication about technical debt.
