\subsection{Research question}

The goal of this paper is to design a concept of a visualization tool to aggregate and present an overview of technical debt in a software development project.
In doing that, his thesis aims to investigate whether a information visualization tool can be used to empower software development teams to make better informed decisions about software architecture and source code maintenance on order to manage technical debt.
Based on this goal, this paper will try to answer the following research question.

\smallskip
\textbf{
Can a visualization tool help software development teams manage technical debt by informing decisions regarding maintenance and refactoring?
}
\smallskip

In order to answer the research question, a prototype of a visualization tool will be developed and evaluated based on the following sub-questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the prototype present enough information for developers to make decisions about if and when to pay off technical debt?
\item Can the prototype help improve awareness about technical debt strategy and decisions withing a software development team?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delimitations}
The main objective of this study is to evaluate a design concept, not developing a fully functioning visualization tool.
Only the features and interactions necessary to properly evaluate the concept and generate design guidelines will be implemented in the prototype.
