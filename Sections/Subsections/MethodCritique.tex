\subsection{Method Critique}
Some points to mention:

- Few participants from recruited from two companies might not translate into developers in general?

- Only one design iteration, can the results be valuable?

- Remote interviews and special circumstances of the study, does that impact the results?

- Was the prototype able to fully capture the concept in order for it to be evaluated? Too many missing features?
