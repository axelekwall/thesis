\subsection{Interviews}

The prototype was then evaluated through semi-structured interviews with users in which the users were able to interact with and explore the interactive prototype.

The interview participants in the study were recruited from two companies, Mentimeter AB and Prototyp Stockholm AB, one of which is a digital agency while the other is a product company providing a SaaS solution for interactive presentations. TODO: describe the participants in more detail.

A couple of themes emerged from the answers in the interview: (1) A designated place for debt discussions and decisions, (2) More levels of granularity, (3) Integrations with existing workflow.
