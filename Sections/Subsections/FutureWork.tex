\subsection{Future Work}
The visualizations used in this study to represent a project was, according to many of the users in the evaluation, not able to fully capture all the complexity of a large software project.
Other visualization techniques do need to be evaluated in future studies to find a suitable representation, or collection of representations, that can fully capture a whole project and present a intuitive visual representation for users.
This would be necessary in order for a technical debt tool, like the one proposed in this study, to be able to present the user with a good overview of the magnitude and location of technical debt in a software project.
