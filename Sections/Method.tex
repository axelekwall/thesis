\section{Method}
In this section the overall methodology used in this paper is presented. Each step is described in more detail in the next section "Study and results" together with the results.

TODO: Update this section to better reflect the actual method after changes because of covid-19.

In order to investigate the research question, a methodology informed by Stoltermans Concept-Driven Design Research was used. \cite{stolterman_concept-driven_2010}
A single design iteration was conducted in three main steps listed below.

\smallskip
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Gather requirements through a survey.
  \item Explore design space and develop design artefact, an interactive prototype of the concept.
  \item Critique session, user study with prepared tasks and interview.
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip

\subsection{Survey}

TODO: Rewrite this part

The critique sessions was conducted with participants form the target group; developers, designers and project managers at Mentimeter AB. 
The critique session during the first iteration will be a focus group workshop where the participants will be presented with the concept idea and low-fi prototypes and sketches created during the first two steps. 
This session will be structured like group interview and workshop where the goal is to get early feedback on the overall concept design and help in choosing a direction for the second integration.

\subsection{Interviews}
When the defined concept and features were implemented in the prototype, interviews were conducted in order to evaluate the concept and high level functionalities presented with prototype. 
This session aimed to gather more specific critique and was structured as task- based user tests in a one-on-one setting where participants were asked to complete a set of tasks with the interactive prototype, followed by a semi-structured interview.

TODO: Describe this more thoroughly.
